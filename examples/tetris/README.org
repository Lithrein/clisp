* Requirements

As long as your system has `make', a C compiler, `pkg-config', and libsdl2 installed,
the following command should be sufficient.

#+begin_src shell
  make && ./tetris
#+end_src

* How to play

The edge are very /ROUGH/, but it is playable. Block do not fall down but each time you
perform a movement they will perform the movement and then fall down.

Keys:

 - UP, rotate right.
 - LEFT, move left.
 - RIGHT, move right.
 - DOWN, soft drop.
 - SPACE, hard drop.
 - SHIFT, hold (but you can't see the hold space)
